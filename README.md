First Fantasy - A Very Basic Text-Based RPG Demo
A DOM based Web Game - Written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript

In this very silly and very short game, you are the Probably Chosen One. That is to say, you are the hero of this land blessed by 
some sort of diety to stop the Demon Lord Emperor of Kinging from ruling the world. Thankfully the Demon Lord's rule has only
just begun so you have some time to get yourself situated. But first, before you do any of that, you must escape this jail!

You will be prompted to choose your name upon opening the game page. This is the name that will be used in the adventure.

After that, you will be able to click the Start button and the adventure will begin!

You should expect to see one NPC, and three enemies in the dungeon. You will not be able to leave until all enemies are defeated. 
Since you were recently imprisoned, you have no armor, and no weapons. Maybe you can find a weapon somewhere in the dungeon.

Make sure to Look around to get a feel for your surroundings!

Enjoy!
