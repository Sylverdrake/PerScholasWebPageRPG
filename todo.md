TO DO

Day 1: Wireframe and Finalization of Plans - Begin writing out pseudocode for everything you want to do and finalize logic loops. 

Create a character with stats
    Make sure the character can level up via gaining skillpoints
    Make sure the character's level cannot exceed a certain value
    Make sure leveling increases stats properly
    
    Make skills for the character
    Make a skillshop to use skill points at, which can be accessed at any time


Day 2: Create Demo Run -> Create basic class with basic equipment, basic location with a shop, a quest which rewards things, a monster which drops things, and a final boss.


Day 3: Finalize Demo Run -> Make sure it works in console! Then make sure it works on the webpage.
Day 3.5: Figure out how to slow it down and make it work with buttons and text and not just run through everything at lightspeed

Day 4: TEST IT ALL AND MAKE SURE IT WORKS
