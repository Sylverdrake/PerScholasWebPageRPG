Main Screen for display of text and interact with the world
2nd Sidebar for Quest Log, Tabs for Inventory, Equipped Items

---GAMEPLAY PLAN---

Choose your name, and insert that into the starting prompt. 
Use Buttons to move around world
Use Text for some prompts??

Player creates character and is tasked with defeating the Final Boss.
Player starts in Location. Buttons can be used to access different scenes, and can talk with different NPCs.
NPCs will give Quests, which will be added to 'Quest Log'
Completion of Quests grants money and Skill Points when the goal is met.
Player does this until they reach the location to defeat the Final Boss
Defeating Final Boss wins the game
if HP hits 0 at any time, you lose, and must restart (or restart from a save point if I can figure that out)
